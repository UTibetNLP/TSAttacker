# TSAttacker

## Introduction

We divided our work in the paper below into two parts.

***Pay Attention to the Robustness of Chinese Minority Language Models! Syllable-level Textual Adversarial Attack on Tibetan Script (Cao et al., ACL 2023 Workshop - TrustNLP)***

One of them is the fine-tuning part which is open-sourced on [https://github.com/metaphors/TibetanPLMsFineTuning](https://github.com/metaphors/TibetanPLMsFineTuning).

The other one is the attacker part which is open-sourced on [https://github.com/metaphors/TibetanAdversarialAttack](https://github.com/metaphors/TibetanAdversarialAttack).
